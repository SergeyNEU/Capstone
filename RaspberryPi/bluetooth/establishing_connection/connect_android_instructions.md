To execute the `connect_android.sh` script, you don't need to compile it like you would with other programming languages (e.g., C or Java). Instead, you just need to ensure the script has executable permissions and then run it from the terminal. Here are the step-by-step instructions:

1. **Save the script:** Make sure the script is saved as `connect_android.sh` in your desired directory.
2. **Set executable permissions:** Open a terminal window, navigate to the directory where the script is saved, and run the following command:
```bash
chmod +x connect_android.sh
```
This command sets the executable permission for the script, allowing it to be run as a program.

3. **Execute the script:** To execute the script, run the following command in the terminal:
```bash
./connect_android.sh
```
The script should now start executing, and you'll see the output as it progresses through the pairing and connection process.

**Note:** Since the script uses `sudo` to run some commands with root privileges, you may be prompted to enter your password during execution. Be prepared to enter your password when prompted.
