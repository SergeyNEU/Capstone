I explain the building blocks of the code.

Start with cameraBrainstorming

Then go to machineLearningBrainstorming.

Go back to cameraBrainstorming to see how classifier is used.

Next go to sensehatBrainstorming.

Finally, go to bluetooth2ndStageBrainstorming. There I implement mock bluetooth setup as well as a second stage where results stored in buffer if no bluetooth connection present.

Enjoy! -Sergey
